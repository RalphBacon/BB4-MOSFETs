The MOSFET transistor has all but replaced BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors) in Arduino-style circuits which require a decent switching device to control motors, relays, LEDs and everything else.

Not only are they cheap to buy, they are also easy to use - but just watch the static handling requirements! In other words, do NOT touch the pins with your hands.

Let's have a look at how they fit into the Arduino World in this video.
